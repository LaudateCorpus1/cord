# cord

Experimental websocket client for Discord gateways. It parses events and handles gateway retrieval and reconnections transparently.


```go
socket := cord.New("my token", nil)

socket.On(Ready(func (r *model.Ready) {
    fmt.Printf("Connected!\n")
}))

socket.On(MessageCreate(func (msg *model.Message) {
    fmt.Printf("%s said %s\n", msg.Author.Username, msg.Content)
}))

```

### Development

JSON and the event handlers are auto-generated by the Makefile. Running `make` will ensure the generations are up-to-date and run all tests.
